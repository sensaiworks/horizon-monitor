"""
Structured event store (SQLite) — the durable, queryable source of truth.

ChromaDB (src/rag.py) handles *semantic* search ("anything about deployments").
This store handles *exact* and *temporal* questions that vector search is bad at —
"everything John said between 9 and 11am", "the last 20 events", counts per
speaker/channel. Both stores are keyed on the same MessageEvent.doc_id(), so a row
here and a vector there refer to the same message.

It is also the dedup gate: ingest() uses INSERT OR IGNORE on the doc_id primary key
and returns only the rows that were genuinely new, so callers embed/notify each
message exactly once even though the poller re-reads the same screen repeatedly.

SQLite is opened with check_same_thread=False because the tray drains events on a
different thread than the monitor loop; writes are serialised through one connection.
